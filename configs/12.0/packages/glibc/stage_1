# GLIBC build parameters for stage 1 32/64 bits
# =============================================
#

# We can't use the newly built gcc to compile glibc because it will set the
# dynamic linker to be ${dest}/lib/ld.so.1, which isn't installed until the
# glibc build finishes.  So trying to run anything compiled with the new gcc
# will fail, in particular, glibc configure tests.  I suppose you might be
# able to supply glibc configure with lots of libc_cv_* variables to
# avoid this, but then you'd forever be changing this script to keep up with
# new glibc configure tests.
# Note that dynamically linked programs built here with the old host gcc are
# subtly broken too;  The glibc build sets their dynamic linker to
# ${dest}/lib/ld.so.1 but doesn't provide rpath.  Which means you'll get the
# new ld.so trying to use the system libc.so, which doesn't work.  ld.so and
# libc.so share data structures so are tightly coupled.  To run the new
# programs, you need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for them, or better (so as to not
# affect forked commands that might need the system libs), run ld.so.x
# explicitly, passing --library-path as is done for localedef below.
# This is one of the reasons why you need to build glibc twice.

# Include some standard functions
