				<h2>Support</h2>
				<p>Customer support for the Advance Toolchain (AT) is provided in one of three ways:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>If you are using AT as directed by an IBM product team (ex.: IBM XL Compiler or PowerVM Lx86) please report suspected AT problems to IBM Support using that product name and entitlement.</li>
					<li>IBM's Support Line for Linux Offerings now provides support for the Advance Toolchain as well. If you have a contract with a Support Line for Linux, place a call to IBM Support, e.g. for United States:
						<ul>
							<li>Dial 1-800-426-IBM-SERV</li>
							<li>Option #2 (Other business products or solutions)</li>
							<li>Option #2 (Software)</li>
							<li>Option #7 (Other OS/Linux)</li>
						</ul>
						For other countries <a href="http://www.ibm.com/planetwide/">click here</a>.
						</li>
					<li>All other users can use an electronic forum that is monitored Monday through Friday. For questions regarding the use of or to report a suspected defect in AT, click <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/forum?id=a95a744c-e8fd-4228-a57a-1ae837efe457" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<ul>
							<li>Log in.</li>
							<li>Start a topic.</li>
							<li>Enter and save your question or problem.</li>
							<li>An initial response will be attempted within 2 business days.</li>
						</ul></li>

				<h2>Installation</h2>
				__INST__
				<h3>Manual installation for rpms</h3>
				<p>If you are installing the rpms manually you will need to install them in the following order (due to prerequisites):</p>
				<pre class="codebox">
advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-runtime-__VERSION_RELEASE__
advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-devel-__VERSION_RELEASE__
advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-perf-__VERSION_RELEASE__
advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-mcore-libs-__VERSION_RELEASE__
advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-runtime-at__OLD_VERSION__-compat-__VERSION_RELEASE__
				</pre>
				<p>If you are updating a previous installation, you need to update as a batch, so rpm can solve the dependencies, i.e.:</p>
				<pre class="codebox">
rpm -Uvh advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-runtime-__VERSION_RELEASE__.ppc64.rpm \
         advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-devel-__VERSION_RELEASE__.ppc64.rpm \
         advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-perf-__VERSION_RELEASE__.ppc64.rpm \
         advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-mcore-__VERSION_RELEASE__.ppc64.rpm \
         advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-runtime-at__OLD_VERSION__-compat-__VERSION_RELEASE__.ppc64.rpm
				</pre>
				<p>The <span class="code">rpm</span> command should always be run as <b>root</b>. Failure to do so will result in an error similar to this:</p>
				<p class="codebox">
				error: can't create transaction lock on /var/lib/rpm/__db.000
				</p>
				<h3>Important notes</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Timezone files</u>: If you need to use something different than Factory, then you should copy the timezone file you want from <span class="code">/opt/__VERSION__/share/zoneinfo</span> to <span class="code">/opt/__VERSION__/etc/localtime</span></li>
					<li><u><span class="code">advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-runtime-compat-__VERSION_RELEASE__</span></u>: <b>DO NOT INSTALL</b> it on <u>RHEL7 and beyond</u>. These are intended for runtime compatibility on <u>RHEL6</u> <b>only</b> (see below).</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Installation for runtime compatibility on previous distribution versions</h3>
				<p>Users running applications on previous distributions of SLES or RHEL may install the compatibility rpm <span class="code">advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-runtime-compat-__VERSION_RELEASE__</span> in order to get the Advance Toolchain runtime libraries.</p>
				<h3>Installation of the cross-compiler (x86)</h3>
				<p>You can download <span class="code">advance-toolchain-__VERSION__-cross-__VERSION_RELEASE__</span> and install in a x86 machine to build Power binaries on it. Binaries generated by the cross-compiler will run on a Power system with the same version of the Advance Toolchain installed.</p>
