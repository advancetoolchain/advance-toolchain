# This is a package function to verify the make_check log.
# In some cases 'make check' will return 0 even though the log shows that
# there some failures did occur.  Define this function for
# packages where that has happened.  Due to differences in the implementations
# of 'make check' or 'make test' the strings that indicate failure could
# be different.
