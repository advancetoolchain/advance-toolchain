# Generic build support options
# =============================
# Most of these options are self explanatory, Some highlights on obscure ones
# - BUILD_ARCH must contain the target toolchain arch (ppc64/ppc32)
# - BUILD_LOAD_ARCH tell us the CPU base to use for loader compatibility (GLIBC).
# - BUILD_BASE_ARCH tell us the CPU base to use for base code generation (GCC).
# - BUILD_OPTIMIZATION tells which is the default base optimization level (GCC).
# - BUILD_WITH_LONGDOUBLE tells us to build with support for longdoubles.
# - BUILD_WITH_DFP_STANDALONE tells us to build with libdfp as standalone library.
# - BUILD_RPM_PACKAGER tells us the name / email of packager for this release.
# - BUILD_RPMS must be set to "granular" or "monolithic" to indicate the kind of
#   rpms to be generated by the build script. See the documentation notes.

# When running on ppc64le, BUILD_ARCH defaults to ppc64le
# In the rest, it defaults to ppc64.
ifeq ($(HOST_ARCH),ppc64le)
    BUILD_ARCH ?= ppc64le
