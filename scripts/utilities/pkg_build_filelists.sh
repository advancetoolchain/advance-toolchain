# File: pkg_build_filelists.sh
#
# Description
#   Check which kind of rpm should be generated: monolithic or granular
#   - Monolithic: only four main packages + compatibility runtime
#   - Granular: each package has its own original package and they are grouped
#     by meta-packages, or package groups into the four main packages +
#     compatibility runtime.
#
# Parameters
# - none
#

# Load required external functions
source "${utilities}/pkg_build_granular.sh"
source "${utilities}/pkg_build_monolithic.sh"

# Decide which kind of build to perform by the definition present on
# rpm_build_type (granular|monolithic).
# We have used since the beginning the monolithic build type, but
# there may be chances to implement the former one sometime in the
# future...
