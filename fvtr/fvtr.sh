# This script is the main driver script for the Function Verification Test
# An optional argument is a list of tests to be run.  Each test will be in
# its own subdirectory and the name of the primary test script is the
# subdirectory’s name with a .exp extension.  If the list of tests is not
# supplied, this script will run all tests.  It does this
# by creating a list of subdirectories and loops thru the list calling each
# ‘primary’ test script in that directory.

# The test scripts are passed three arguments, the name of the script being
# run, where to direct the output, and the AT_PLATFORM on which the test is
# being run.
